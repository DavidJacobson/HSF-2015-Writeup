High School Forensics 2015
===================


This is a write up for HSF 2015 qualifers. It ran for around two weeks, and was hosted by NYU Polytech's ISIS lab. There were 10 categories: Web, Steganography, Reversing, Cryptography, Disk Forensics, Network, Photo-Rensics, Filez, Trivia, and Recon.
My team Machshev (מחשב) ended up 7th in the North East, and 2nd in New York.

This repo contains writeups for some challenges, as of now I am writing them based off what I still have locally because the challenges have been taken offline.

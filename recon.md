Twinsies
=========
For this challenge we are told Meghan has a twin brother that she is very close with, and he likes to get involved in the flags.
We can start out by figuring out who 'Meghan' is. We can find her full name from either the hsf website, or Github. 
Once we find Meghan Caiazzo, some quick googling gives us her brother's name: Rob. We go to her twitter, and go through followers, we can find 
him as 'the real bobby' His description is: A weirdo but im real doe, follow the sisters @mcaiazzo which is how we find it is him. From here we just go to 
his profile, and he tweeted the flag.
```
flag: #tWINNING

For this challenge we need to get breadchris's birthday. We start by checking Github, he as a commit:
```
+HSF Hint: Maybe it is on a calendar somewhere?

```
So we know to check a calendar somewhere.

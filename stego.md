Steganography
===================

What's the difference - 500
----------
For this challenge, we are given a single png file titled 'bane.png' 
<img src="img/bane.png" alt="" width="500" height="500">

On initial inspection, everything seems to be in order. The only thing that seems out of place is the fact that the image is 27 mb.

So I examined the file a little more:

```
david@redacted: strings bane.png
IHDR
        pHYs
 cHRM
[IDATx
IEND
IHDR
        pHYs
 cHRM
[IDATx
IEND
```
What's odd here is that there are two IHDRs. Upon examination there are two PNG file headers. This means that bane.png is actually housing two files, which would explain the large file size. 

I opened it in a hex editor, and searched for "â€°PNG", the PNG file header (or 89 50 4E 47 in hex). I found the second occurence of PNG and copied from 0x00000000 to 0xDF93D5. I saved that as 1.png, and then I copied from 0xDF93D5 to 0x1BF27AA. This gave me two files, but when I opened them they appeared to have the same image, identical to the original and eachother. The files were not identical though, looks can be deceiving. 
```
david@redacted: diff 1.png 2.png
Binary files 1.png and 2.png differ
```
and just to confirm:
```
david@redacted: md5 1.png 2.png
F1483C53E6559F6641B43C41B28C9ED2  1.png
0261AD87DBCDA7364F18EFA648BBAE9E  2.png
```
So these two files are different, but how? 
I can use imagemagick to diff the images, and save the output to an image.
```
compare 1.png 2.png  diff.png
```
And this gives us a new image:
<img src="img/diff.png" alt="" width="500" height="500">

We can scan this QR code and we get: flag{steeanography_is_the_bane_of_my_existance}
```
Flag: flag{steganography_is_the_bane_of_my_existance}
```

Steganography
===================

What's the difference - 500
----------
For this challenge, we are given a single png file titled 'bane.png' 
<img src="img/bane.png" alt="" width="500" height="500">

On initial inspection, everything seems to be in order. The only thing that seems out of place is the fact that the image is 27 mb.
